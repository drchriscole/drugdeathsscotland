# Drug-related deaths in Scotland 2018

A repository for analysing [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/deaths/drug-related-deaths-in-scotland/2017) annual data on drug-related deaths in Scotland.

Primarily this is an exercise dataviz to improve on the hard-to-digest spreadsheet tables to improve on the understanding of themes and trends.

Starting with the 2018 data there is substantially more regional detail which makes for a lot more analysis. As I'm based in Dundee, I've highlighted the serious problem that exists here.

## MyBinder Jupyter Notebook testing

The MyBinder link a little fragile; for a given git commit one or either or both binder links work. *Caveat emptor*

Rstudio: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/drchriscole/drugdeathsscotland/binder_test?filepath=rstudio)

This launches a full and working Rstudio environment to run the code interactively.

Rmarkdown: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/drchriscole/drugdeathsscotland/binder_test?filepath=DRD_in_Scotland_Visualisations.Rmd)

This launches an interactive notebook of the markdown.
