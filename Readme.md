# Drug-related deaths in Scotland 2018

A repository for analysing [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/deaths/drug-related-deaths-in-scotland/2017) annual data on drug-related deaths in Scotland.

Primarily this is an exercise dataviz to improve on the hard-to-digest spreadsheet tables to improve on the understanding of themes and trends.

Starting with the 2018 data there is substantially more regional detail which makes for a lot more analysis. As I'm based in Dundee, I've highlighted the serious problem that exists here.
